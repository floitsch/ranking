/// Computes the Bradley-Terry Ranking for the players in the given [games].
///
/// The [games] list must consist of pairs (list of two elements) of two players
/// where the order determines which player one. That is, the first player of
/// the pair won that particular game.
///
/// The returned map assigns a score to each player. The higher the score, the
/// more likely that player is to win in a paired comparison.
///
/// The Bradley-Terry model is a model that predicts the outcome of a paired
/// comparison. The model is transitive, and as such provides a complete
/// ranking.
///
/// Contrary to ELO, the Bradley-Terry ranking is _static_. It does *not*
/// consider the variation in time of the strengths of players.
